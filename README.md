- <strong>Description:</strong> This provides 5 free sample interview problems. It asks you to try to solve the problem first, then when you click "I have an answer" it checks to make sure you thought about the gotcha's. Once you get through the gotcha's it gives an indepth solution of how they chose to solve it. Goal is to have the smallest processing time.
