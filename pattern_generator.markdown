# Pattern Generator

We want to generate serial numbers for our products as they roll off the manufacturing line. Patterns for the
numbers are written like `XXNXN` where `X` stands for an uppercase letter A-Z and `N` stands for a digit 0-9.

Write a program which, given a pattern like `XXNXN`, can generate all possible serial numbers for that pattern *and*
report out how many numbers were generated.
